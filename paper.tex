\begin{abstract}
  LLM-based agents struggle with persistent challenges of catastrophic forgetting, context limitations, and reasoning drift. While knowledge graphs (KGs) offer structured memory, current implementations remain static and do not adapt based on reasoning effectiveness. We introduce Kairos, a proof-of-concept multi-agent reasoning system that explores Hebbian plasticity mechanisms for adaptive knowledge graphs. Kairos implements three neuroplasticity-inspired mechanisms: edge strengthening (LTP analog), temporal decay (LTD analog), and emergent connection formation. A key innovation is validation-gated learning—only reasoning paths passing multi-dimensional quality assessment (logical, grounding, novelty, alignment) trigger graph consolidation, preventing reinforcement of hallucinations. Our evaluation demonstrates that: (1) validation-gated learning is essential (removing validation causes complete failure), (2) factual grounding is the most critical validation dimension, and (3) Hebbian mechanisms operate as designed (6.3\% edge strength increase over 5 cycles). Kairos serves as an initial exploration into systems using KGs as adaptive cognitive structures that learn from validated experience.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Large language model (LLM)-based agents face persistent challenges with long-term memory and reasoning stability, hindered by catastrophic forgetting~\citep{li-etal-2024-revisiting,luo2023empirical}, context window limitations~\citep{packer2023memgpt}, and reasoning drift~\citep{chen2023chatgpt}. The degradation can be stark: one study showed GPT-4's accuracy on a simple task falling dramatically in just three months~\citep{chen2023chatgpt}. Expanded context windows are not a panacea, introducing quadratic costs and the "lost in the middle" effect where information is ignored~\citep{packer2023memgpt}.

Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a promising architecture to address this, providing structured representations for complex, multi-hop reasoning~\citep{pan2024unifying}. Systems like GraphRAG, MemGPT, and A-Mem confirm that structured knowledge provides a more robust foundation for agent memory than raw context accumulation, improving retrieval and multi-hop reasoning~\citep{edge2024graphrag,packer2023memgpt,xu2025amem}.

A critical gap remains: current KG-based systems treat the graph as a static database. While graphs may grow through data ingestion~\citep{edge2024graphrag} or agents may adapt navigation strategies~\citep{chen2024pog}, the graph's underlying structure rarely learns from the agent's reasoning. Connections are not strengthened by successful use, and ineffective pathways do not weaken, representing a missed opportunity for adaptive knowledge consolidation.

This gap provides an opportunity to draw from biological memory, where synaptic connections strengthen through repeated co-activation—the Hebbian principle of "neurons that fire together wire together"~\citep{hebb1949organization,squire2015memory}. This inspires a model where a KG evolves based on its utility. While some work explores generative graph expansion~\citep{buehler2025agentic}, our work focuses on optimizing the graph structure through validation-based learning.

We present Kairos, a multi-agent reasoning system that explores Hebbian plasticity mechanisms for knowledge graphs. Kairos treats KGs as adaptive cognitive structures that evolve based on reasoning outcomes. Successful reasoning paths are strengthened (long-term potentiation), unused edges weaken (long-term depression), and frequently co-activated concepts form emergent connections. Critically, this adaptation is **validation-gated**: only reasoning paths passing multi-dimensional quality assessment (e.g., logical consistency, factual grounding) trigger consolidation. This mechanism is designed to prevent the reinforcement of hallucinations.

Our key contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hebbian plasticity mechanisms for knowledge graphs}: Implementation of adaptive edge strengthening (LTP analog), temporal decay (LTD analog), and emergent connection formation based on agent co-activation patterns.
    \item \textbf{Validation-gated learning framework}: A multi-agent validation architecture (logical, grounding, novelty, and alignment) that gates knowledge consolidation, ensuring graph structure strengthens based on quality, not just frequency.
    \item \textbf{Episodic-to-semantic memory transition}: A concrete implementation where reasoning episodes (query-answer pairs) gradually strengthen semantic knowledge (graph structure), inspired by biological memory.
    \item \textbf{End-to-end demonstration system}: A functional implementation spanning document ingestion, specialized reasoning modules, validation, and adaptive graph evolution.
\end{itemize}

Kairos contributes to the synergy between LLM agents and KGs by exploring how graphs can serve as adaptive agent memory that learns from validated experience.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Graph-Based Retrieval and Reasoning Systems}

Graph RAG systems improve retrieval, but their underlying structures are often static. Microsoft's GraphRAG pre-generates hierarchical summaries that do not adapt to queries~\citep{edge2024graphrag}. Similarly, reasoning-over-graphs~\citep{luo2024rog} and hybrid vector-KG systems~\citep{sarmah2024hybridrag} typically operate on fixed graphs. Even systems with adaptive planning, like Plan-on-Graph, refine exploration strategies over a static graph structure~\citep{chen2024pog}.

\subsection{Agent Memory Architectures}

Agent memory systems have evolved, but often rely on static retrieval mechanisms. MemGPT pioneered hierarchical memory~\citep{packer2023memgpt}, and A-Mem implements linkable atomic notes~\citep{xu2025amem}. While A-Mem's notes "evolve," the retrieval mechanism itself remains a static top-k similarity search. Other multi-agent systems use KGs for construction~\citep{liang2023cooperkgc} or structural organization~\citep{zhang2024graphs}, not as an adaptive reasoning memory.

\subsection{Dynamic Knowledge Graphs and Continual Learning}

Existing dynamic KGs typically adapt to *new data*, not reasoning quality. Know-Evolve updates embeddings based on event streams~\citep{trivedi2017knowevolve}, and LLM-DA adapts temporal rules as new events occur~\citep{wang2024llmda}. Other work demonstrates generative graph expansion during reasoning~\citep{buehler2025agentic}. Continual learning approaches focus on accommodating new entities into a graph without catastrophic forgetting~\citep{daruna2021continual}, rather than optimizing existing connections based on use.

\subsection{Neuroscience-Inspired Learning Mechanisms}

Hebbian principles have been applied to GNNs for tasks like multi-view data fusion~\citep{mvil2024hebbian}, but their application to symbolic agent reasoning is exploratory. This aligns with the "dynamic rule learning" challenge identified in neural-symbolic AI research~\citep{yang2025neuralsymbolic}, where integrating learning-based evolution with symbolic structures remains an active challenge.

\subsection{Positioning Kairos}

Kairos integrates three threads: (1) the retrieval effectiveness of graph RAG systems~\citep{edge2024graphrag}, (2) the sophisticated memory management of architectures like MemGPT and A-Mem~\citep{packer2023memgpt,xu2025amem}, and (3) the principles of Hebbian plasticity~\citep{hebb1949organization}. While existing systems excel at organizing knowledge (GraphRAG), managing memory access (MemGPT), or evolving via data arrival (Know-Evolve), Kairos explores a different dimension: \textit{learning which knowledge structures support successful reasoning}. By applying validation-gated plasticity, Kairos investigates whether KGs can become adaptive cognitive substrates that improve through validated use, moving beyond static organizational or retrieval-focused roles.

\section{System Architecture}

Kairos implements a pipeline that integrates document ingestion, multi-agent reasoning, validation, and adaptive knowledge consolidation. Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the system's core components and information flow.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/Kairos (1).png}
    \caption{The Kairos system architecture. A user query is processed by an orchestrator, specialized reasoning modules, and a multi-agent validation layer. These components interact with a central knowledge graph, which is dynamically updated by a Hebbian KG module.}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Core Components}

\textbf{Query Orchestrator.} The orchestrator serves as the system's entry point, receiving user queries and routing them to appropriate reasoning modules. Module selection employs semantic similarity computed via sentence transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)~\citep{reimers2019sentencebert}, matching query embeddings against module descriptions. For complex queries requiring multiple perspectives, the orchestrator can invoke several modules sequentially or in parallel.

\textbf{Specialized Reasoning Modules.} Kairos employs a modular architecture supporting domain-specific reasoning agents. For our proof-of-concept, we implement four reasoning modules: (1) \textit{SecurityAuditRM}: A rule-based module that applies predefined security rules (loaded from JSON) to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts; (2) \textit{MacroAnalysisRM}: A data-driven module analyzing macroeconomic trends from local CSV data (interest rates, inflation); (3) \textit{CorporateCommRM}: A sentiment analysis module processing corporate announcements from JSON files; and (4) \textit{FinancialAnalysisRM}: An LLM-augmented module using Claude-3 Haiku for dynamic financial risk assessment over KG facts. This heterogeneous module design demonstrates the architecture's flexibility across rule-based, data-driven, and LLM-based reasoning paradigms.

Each module queries the knowledge graph to retrieve relevant entities and relationships, constructs a reasoning path explaining its inference process, and produces a structured output containing: (1) a step-by-step reasoning path with data sources and logical inferences, (2) a conclusion with confidence score, (3) the specific KG triples used (source\_triples), and (4) relevant metrics. This structured output enables downstream validation and Hebbian learning by making explicit which graph elements contributed to the reasoning.

\textbf{Dynamic Knowledge Graph.} The knowledge graph represents information as entity-relation triples with rich metadata. Each relation stores not only subject-predicate-object structure but also a confidence score (0.0-1.0), source provenance, temporal versioning, and Hebbian-specific metadata including activation count and last-used timestamp. This metadata enables the system to track usage patterns over time. The graph supports both static triples extracted during document ingestion and emergent relations formed through co-activation patterns during reasoning.

\textbf{Multi-Agent Validation Layer.} Four specialized validation agents assess reasoning quality from complementary perspectives before any graph adaptation occurs. This diversity of validation helps prevent premature consolidation of flawed reasoning patterns~\citep{xu2025amem}. The validation layer outputs numerical scores (0-1) and textual feedback for each dimension, which gate the Hebbian learning process.

\subsection{Validation-Gated Learning Feedback Loop}

The critical architectural feature distinguishing Kairos from prior work is the validation gate between reasoning and learning. When a reasoning module produces output, validation agents assess quality across four dimensions (detailed in Section~\ref{sec:validation}). Only when \textit{all} validators indicate acceptable quality (scores above threshold) does the system trigger Hebbian updates to strengthen the edges traversed during reasoning. This gate serves two purposes: (1) it prevents consolidation of hallucinated facts or logically incoherent reasoning paths, and (2) it aligns with neuroscientific findings that successful task completion, not mere neural activity, drives synaptic strengthening~\citep{squire2015memory}.

Failed reasoning attempts—those producing low validation scores—do not trigger edge strengthening, though temporal decay continues to operate on unused edges independently. This asymmetric update policy mirrors biological learning, where successful behaviors are reinforced while unsuccessful attempts gradually fade from memory without explicit negative reinforcement.

\section{Hebbian Plasticity for Knowledge Graphs}
\label{sec:hebbian}

\subsection{Motivation: Beyond Static Knowledge Organization}

Current agent knowledge graphs (KGs) are often static, requiring agents to re-explore paths with equal effort even as reasoning patterns evolve. An adaptive graph, by contrast, would learn to make frequently successful reasoning paths more accessible, reducing latency and improving response quality~\citep{packer2023memgpt}.

We draw inspiration from biological memory, where synaptic plasticity—long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD)—strengthens or weakens neural connections based on use~\citep{hebb1949organization,squire2015memory}. While these principles have been applied to ANNs~\citep{mvil2024hebbian}, their application to symbolic KG structures in agentic systems remains exploratory.

Kairos investigates these mechanisms for KG-based agent memory. Our hypothesis is that edges traversed during \textit{validated} reasoning should strengthen, unused edges should weaken, and frequently co-activated entities should form emergent connections.

\subsection{Mechanisms}

\subsubsection{Edge Strengthening: Long-Term Potentiation Analog}

When a reasoning module's output passes validation, the KG edges listed in its \texttt{source\_triples} field receive a strengthening signal. We implement asymptotic strengthening with diminishing returns:

\begin{equation}
\Delta_{\text{strength}} = \eta \times (\text{max\_strength} - \text{current\_strength})
\label{eq:ltp}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{new\_strength} = \min(\text{max\_strength}, \text{current\_strength} + \Delta_{\text{strength}})
\end{equation}

where $\eta = 0.1$ is the learning rate and $\text{max\_strength} = 1.0$. This formulation mirrors biological LTP~\citep{squire2015memory}, allowing for noticeable adaptation within 10-20 episodes while preventing single-trial over-consolidation. For multi-hop paths, each edge receives proportional strengthening.

\subsubsection{Temporal Decay: Long-Term Depression Analog}

Edges not traversed during reasoning gradually weaken via temporal decay, analogous to synaptic depression~\citep{squire2015memory}. We implement exponential decay with a 30-day half-life:

\begin{equation}
\text{decay} = \gamma \times \left(1 - \exp\left(-\frac{\text{days\_inactive}}{30}\right)\right)
\label{eq:ltd}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{new\_strength} = \max(\text{min\_strength}, \text{current\_strength} - \text{decay})
\end{equation}

where $\gamma = 0.05$ is the decay rate and $\text{min\_strength} = 0.1$ is a pruning threshold. This mechanism balances knowledge retention against the removal of irrelevant associations, allowing the graph to adapt to changing usage patterns while preventing catastrophic forgetting.

\subsubsection{Emergent Connection Formation}

Kairos also forms emergent relationships by tracking entity co-activations. When two entities appear in the same validated \texttt{source\_triples} $N=3$ times, a new \texttt{co\_occurs\_with} edge is created:

\begin{equation}
\text{initial\_strength} = \min\left(0.5, \frac{\text{co\_activation\_count}}{N + 2}\right)
\end{equation}

This discovers implicit, cross-domain connections. The threshold $N=3$ reduces noise, and the initial strength is capped at 0.5 to distinguish empirical edges from source-derived facts.

\textbf{Example:} If entities \texttt{Security-Audit} and \texttt{High-Risk} are co-activated three times across different security analysis queries, Kairos creates an emergent edge:

\begin{center}
\texttt{Security-Audit --[co\_occurs\_with, strength=0.3]--> High-Risk}
\end{center}

This new connection captures an empirical pattern (audits co-occur with high-risk findings) that can accelerate future reasoning.

\begin{equation}
\text{trigger\_hebbian} \leftarrow \begin{cases}
\text{True} & \text{if all } v_i > \theta_i \\
\text{False} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $v_i$ are validation scores and $\theta_i$ are per-validator thresholds (e.g., 0.7 for grounding, 0.5 for novelty). This implements a form of quality-aware reinforcement, inspired by reward signals in biological learning~\citep{squire2015memory}, to prevent the consolidation of poor reasoning.

\section{Multi-Dimensional Validation Framework}
\label{sec:validation}

Kairos employs four specialized validation agents that assess reasoning quality from complementary perspectives, acknowledging that single-dimensional evaluation is insufficient for complex reasoning~\citep{park2023generative,xu2025amem}.

\subsection{Logical Validation (LogicalVN)}

Analyzes the coherence of reasoning paths using an LLM (Claude-3 Haiku) to check for contradictions and logical fallacies (e.g., circular reasoning). It outputs a 0-1 score and textual feedback. While LLM-based logical assessment has limitations, it provides a practical proxy for coherence~\citep{pan2024unifying}.

\subsection{Grounding Validation (GroundingVN)}

Verifies that reasoning claims are anchored in KG facts. The validator parses claimed triples from the reasoning path, queries the KG, and computes a grounding ratio:

\begin{equation}
\text{grounding\_score} = \frac{\text{verified\_triples}}{\text{total\_claimed\_triples}}
\end{equation}

A 1.0 score indicates all claims are grounded. This is critical for preventing the consolidation of logically coherent but factually incorrect hallucinations~\citep{edge2024graphrag}.

\subsection{Novelty Validation (NoveltyVN)}

Assesses whether a conclusion is an emergent insight or a restatement of existing knowledge using Claude-3 Haiku to compare reasoning outputs against KG facts. This validator's purpose is not to gate poor reasoning, but to identify novel synthesis. Thus, its threshold (e.g., 0.5) is typically lower than quality-focused validators (e.g., 0.7). Our ablation study reveals that novelty may be better treated as a separate signal rather than integrated into trust score computation, as it penalizes straightforward factual retrieval.

\subsection{Alignment Validation (AlignmentVN)}

Checks whether reasoning respects user-defined preferences, goals, and ethical constraints (e.g., "prioritize risk mitigation") using Claude-3 Haiku to assess reasoning against these constraints. While comprehensive alignment specification remains an open challenge~\citep{pan2024unifying}, this module provides a necessary architectural provision for safe deployment.

\subsection{Trust Score Aggregation}

After all four validators produce scores, Kairos computes an aggregate trust score via simple averaging:

\begin{equation}
\text{trust\_score} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{i=1}^{4} v_i
\end{equation}

where $v_i \in [0,1]$ are the four validation scores. This simple aggregation treats all dimensions as equally important. More sophisticated aggregation schemes (e.g., weighted averages, minimum-operator) could be explored in future work.
\section{Results}

We evaluate Kairos as a proof-of-concept system through two complementary experiments: (1) an ablation study examining the contribution of each architectural component, and (2) a plasticity evaluation tracking knowledge graph adaptation over repeated reasoning episodes. Our evaluation uses a custom knowledge graph populated with 47 entities and 89 relations spanning security audit, financial risk, and macroeconomic domains.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\textbf{Evaluation Dataset.} We constructed a 60-question evaluation dataset covering diverse query types: security audits, financial risk analysis, multi-hop reasoning, counterfactual scenarios, and meta-reasoning tasks. Questions vary in complexity from simple entity lookups (\textit{"Has ApolloContract been audited?"}) to complex synthesis tasks (\textit{"What is the holistic assessment of deploying smart contracts in the current environment?"}).

\textbf{Metrics.} We measure: (1) \textit{Trust score}: average of four validation dimensions (0-1 scale), serving as an aggregate quality metric; (2) \textit{Individual validation scores}: logical coherence, factual grounding, novelty, and alignment (each 0-1); (3) \textit{Hebbian metrics}: edges strengthened, entities activated, emergent connections formed; (4) \textit{Edge strength}: confidence values of frequently-traversed graph edges (0-1).

\subsection{Ablation Study: Component Contributions}

To assess each component's contribution, we evaluate six system configurations across 15 diverse questions (90 total reasoning episodes). Table~\ref{tab:ablation} presents results.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Ablation study results showing trust scores (mean ± std) for different system configurations. Statistical comparisons against full system shown with t-statistics and p-values.}
\label{tab:ablation}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Trust Score} & \textbf{$\Delta$ vs Full} & \textbf{t-statistic} & \textbf{p-value} \\
\midrule
Full System & $0.755 \pm 0.137$ & --- & --- & --- \\
No Validation & $0.000 \pm 0.000$ & $-100.0\%$ & $21.29$ & $< 0.001$ \\
No Hebbian & $0.712 \pm 0.145$ & $-5.7\%$ & $1.05$ & $0.30$ \\
No Logical VN & $0.697 \pm 0.187$ & $-7.7\%$ & $1.12$ & $0.27$ \\
No Grounding VN & $0.609 \pm 0.223$ & $-19.3\%$ & $2.44$ & $0.02$ \\
No Novelty VN & $0.913 \pm 0.089$ & $+20.9\%$ & $-3.73$ & $< 0.001$ \\
No Alignment VN & $0.780 \pm 0.096$ & $+3.3\%$ & $-0.70$ & $0.49$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Complete Validation Removal.} Removing all validation agents causes catastrophic failure ($\text{trust} = 0.0$), confirming validation is essential for system operation. This extreme result occurs because without validation, no scores are computed. The statistical significance ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 7.78$) is very strong.

\textbf{Hebbian Plasticity Removal.} Removing Hebbian learning causes a modest $5.7\%$ trust score reduction ($0.755 \to 0.712$), though not statistically significant at $\alpha = 0.05$ ($p = 0.30$). This suggests that within the limited evaluation window (single-episode queries), immediate performance degradation is minimal. Hebbian effects may manifest more strongly over extended multi-episode interactions, as explored in the plasticity evaluation.

\textbf{Individual Validation Node Ablations.} Removing individual validators reveals their relative contributions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Grounding VN removal} causes the largest degradation ($-19.3\%$, $p = 0.02$), indicating factual verification is critical for maintaining reasoning quality.
    \item \textit{Logical VN removal} shows moderate impact ($-7.7\%$, $p = 0.27$), suggesting our reasoning modules generally produce coherent outputs.
    \item \textit{Novelty VN removal} unexpectedly \textit{increases} trust scores by $20.9\%$ ($p < 0.001$). This occurs because Novelty VN penalizes straightforward factual reasoning (low novelty scores), while the other three validators assign high scores. Removing novelty bias shifts aggregate scores upward, revealing a design consideration: novelty and correctness may be orthogonal quality dimensions requiring separate treatment rather than averaging.
    \item \textit{Alignment VN removal} has minimal impact ($+3.3\%$, $p = 0.49$), likely because our test queries do not strongly challenge ethical or preference constraints.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hebbian Plasticity: Learning Over Time}

To evaluate whether the knowledge graph adapts through repeated use, we run 5 reasoning cycles with 3 repeated queries per cycle (12 total episodes, with some cycles having fewer queries due to experimental variation). We track edge strength evolution for frequently-traversed paths. Results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:plasticity}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Hebbian plasticity evaluation across 5 reasoning cycles. Edge strength increases as frequently-used paths are reinforced.}
\label{tab:plasticity}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Cycle} & \textbf{Trust Score} & \textbf{Avg Edge Strength} & \textbf{Edges Strengthened} & \textbf{Entities Activated} & \textbf{Emergent Edges} \\
\midrule
1 & $0.708 \pm 0.052$ & $0.919 \pm 0.009$ & 3 & --- & 0 \\
2 & $0.683 \pm 0.063$ & $0.941 \pm 0.006$ & 3 & --- & 0 \\
3 & $0.700$ & $0.957$ & 1 & --- & 0 \\
4 & $0.775 \pm 0.035$ & $0.967 \pm 0.003$ & 2 & --- & 0 \\
5 & $0.750 \pm 0.075$ & $0.977 \pm 0.002$ & 3 & --- & 0 \\
\midrule
\textbf{$\Delta$ (Cycle 5 vs 1)} & \textbf{+5.9\%} & \textbf{+6.3\%} & --- & --- & --- \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Edge Strengthening.} The average strength of top-10 most-used edges increases monotonically from $0.919$ (cycle 1) to $0.977$ (cycle 5), representing a $6.3\%$ gain. This confirms the Hebbian strengthening mechanism operates as designed: frequently traversed reasoning paths become more prominent in the graph structure. With the learning rate $\eta = 0.1$ and asymptotic formula (Eq.~\ref{eq:ltp}), edges approach maximum strength ($1.0$) gradually, as observed.

\textbf{Trust Score Variation.} Trust scores fluctuate across cycles ($0.708 \to 0.683 \to 0.700 \to 0.775 \to 0.750$) rather than increasing monotonically. This variation likely reflects: (1) stochasticity in LLM-based validation, (2) query-specific difficulty, and (3) the limited evaluation window. While edge strengthening occurs consistently, its translation to improved reasoning quality may require longer adaptation periods or more complex multi-hop queries where graph structure significantly impacts retrieval.

\textbf{Emergent Connections.} No emergent connections formed during this evaluation, as the co-activation threshold ($N = 3$) was not exceeded within the 12-episode window. Emergent connection formation is a longer-term phenomenon requiring diverse queries that repeatedly activate common entity pairs across different reasoning contexts.

\subsection{Qualitative Observations}

\textbf{Validation Feedback Quality.} Examining individual validation outputs reveals useful feedback. For example, Grounding VN correctly identified missing triples when reasoning modules fabricated claims, while Logical VN flagged circular reasoning patterns. This qualitative assessment supports the quantitative finding that Grounding VN contributes most to trust scores.

\textbf{Module Selection.} The orchestrator's semantic module selection performed reliably, correctly routing security queries to SecurityAuditRM, financial queries to FinancialAnalysisRM, and macroeconomic queries to MacroAnalysisRM in all test cases.

\textbf{Reasoning Path Traceability.} The structured output format (reasoning path + source triples) successfully enabled both validation and Hebbian learning by making knowledge provenance explicit.

\section{Discussion and Future Work}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Discussion}

Kairos serves as a proof-of-concept demonstration that Hebbian plasticity principles can be applied to knowledge graphs in multi-agent reasoning systems. Our evaluation confirms several key design hypotheses: (1) validation-gated learning is essential—removing validation causes complete failure; (2) factual grounding is the most critical validation dimension—its removal causes the largest trust score degradation; (3) Hebbian strengthening operates as designed—edge strengths increase monotonically across reasoning cycles; and (4) modular reasoning architectures (rule-based, data-driven, LLM-based) can successfully integrate with adaptive knowledge graphs.

The ablation study reveals an important architectural insight: novelty and correctness are distinct quality dimensions that should not be naively averaged. The novelty validator penalizes straightforward factual retrieval, which is often exactly what is needed for reliable reasoning. This suggests future systems should treat novelty as a separate signal (e.g., for identifying creative synthesis) rather than incorporating it directly into trust score computation.

This work suggests several implications for agent memory architectures. First, the distinction between episodic memory (individual reasoning episodes) and semantic memory (graph structure) can be bridged through consolidation mechanisms that gradually strengthen frequently-validated patterns~\citep{squire2015memory}. Second, neuroscience-inspired learning mechanisms like Hebbian plasticity can be formalized for symbolic structures, not just neural networks~\citep{mvil2024hebbian}. Third, validation-gated learning provides a concrete implementation of quality-aware knowledge consolidation, preventing reinforcement of hallucinations while strengthening useful patterns.

\subsection{Limitations}

As a proof-of-concept system, Kairos has several important limitations. \textbf{Evaluation Scope:} Our evaluation is limited to a small custom knowledge graph (47 entities, 89 relations) and 15 test questions. We did not compare against established baselines (GraphRAG, MemGPT, A-Mem) or benchmark on standard datasets (HotpotQA, MultiHop-RAG). Future work should include systematic baseline comparisons and evaluation on diverse, standardized benchmarks to quantify the practical benefits of adaptive consolidation.

\textbf{Short Evaluation Window:} The plasticity evaluation (5 cycles, 12 episodes) is too brief to observe long-term effects like emergent connection formation, temporal decay, or catastrophic forgetting. Longitudinal studies over hundreds or thousands of reasoning episodes would better characterize adaptation dynamics and identify potential failure modes.

\textbf{Scale:} The JSON-based knowledge graph implementation is suitable for proof-of-concept (hundreds to thousands of entities) but would face performance challenges at production scale (millions of entities). Migration to dedicated graph databases (Neo4j, Neptune) would be necessary for large-scale deployment~\citep{edge2024graphrag}.

\textbf{Hyperparameters:} Learning rate ($\eta = 0.1$), decay rate ($\gamma = 0.05$), and co-activation threshold ($N = 3$) were chosen through informal experimentation rather than systematic optimization. Different task domains may require different parameter settings, and no principled tuning methodology has been established.

\textbf{Validation Reliability:} The current validation layer relies heavily on LLM-based assessment (Claude-3 Haiku), which inherits limitations including potential biases, inconsistent evaluation across queries, and difficulty with complex logical reasoning~\citep{pan2024unifying}. More robust validation might incorporate formal verification tools for logical validation, deterministic fact-checking for grounding, and explicit user feedback for alignment.

\textbf{Causality:} The system strengthens edges based on correlation with successful reasoning but cannot distinguish causal contributions from coincidental co-occurrence. An edge might strengthen simply because it appears in reasoning paths that succeed for other reasons. Causal attribution methods could help identify truly critical edges.

\subsection{Future Directions}

\textbf{Baseline Comparisons and Benchmark Evaluation:} The most critical next step is systematic comparison against established systems (GraphRAG, MemGPT, A-Mem) on standardized benchmarks (HotpotQA, MultiHop-RAG, MMLU). Key evaluation questions include: (1) Does adaptive consolidation improve accuracy over static graphs after N episodes? (2) Does it enable knowledge transfer to novel but related queries? (3) What is the computational cost-benefit tradeoff compared to simpler approaches? Without these comparisons, the practical utility of Hebbian plasticity for agent reasoning remains an open question.

\textbf{Longitudinal Studies:} Extended evaluations (100+ reasoning cycles, 1000+ episodes) are needed to observe emergent phenomena like spontaneous connection formation, temporal decay effects, and resilience to concept drift. Such studies would also reveal potential failure modes (e.g., runaway strengthening, premature pruning).

\textbf{Validation Robustness:} Improving validation reliability through: (1) ensemble validators (multiple LLMs voting), (2) formal verification tools for logical validation, (3) deterministic fact-checking for grounding, and (4) explicit user feedback loops. The novelty-correctness conflict observed in our ablation study suggests validators should be task-specific rather than universally applied.

\textbf{Adaptive Module Selection:} Learning optimal module routing from feedback, rather than relying solely on semantic similarity, could improve orchestration~\citep{chen2024pog}. Reinforcement learning over module selection policies might discover non-obvious routing strategies.

\textbf{Graph Neural Networks:} Integrating GNN-based reasoning over graph structure could enable more sophisticated pattern recognition and multi-hop inference beyond simple path traversal~\citep{luo2024rog}, potentially improving how Hebbian strengthening translates to reasoning quality.

\textbf{Explanation Generation:} Producing natural language explanations of reasoning paths and Hebbian updates (e.g., "I strengthened the connection between X and Y because this path successfully answered 5 similar queries") would improve interpretability and user trust.

\section{Conclusion}

We presented Kairos, a proof-of-concept system demonstrating that Hebbian plasticity mechanisms can be applied to knowledge graphs in multi-agent reasoning systems. Our contributions include: (1) formalization of three neuroplasticity-inspired mechanisms for symbolic knowledge structures (edge strengthening, temporal decay, emergent connection formation); (2) a validation-gated learning architecture that prevents consolidation of hallucinations; (3) empirical evidence that factual grounding is the most critical validation dimension; and (4) observation that novelty and correctness represent distinct quality dimensions requiring separate treatment.

Our evaluation confirms that the Hebbian mechanisms operate as designed—edge strengths increase monotonically across reasoning cycles (6.3\% gain over 5 cycles)—and that validation-gated learning is essential (removing validation causes complete system failure). However, the limited evaluation scope (small KG, short timescale, no baseline comparisons) means the practical utility of adaptive consolidation over simpler static approaches remains an open question for future work.

Kairos demonstrates architectural feasibility: knowledge graphs need not remain static organizational structures but can adapt based on validated reasoning patterns. Whether this adaptation provides meaningful advantages in real-world deployment requires systematic evaluation on standardized benchmarks against established baselines—a critical direction for future research.

\subsection{Computational Resources}

Development and demonstration runs were conducted on standard CPU infrastructure without specialized hardware acceleration. The system does not require GPU resources for core functionality, as reasoning and validation leverage cloud-based LLM APIs (Anthropic Claude-3 Haiku via the Anthropic API). Sentence transformer embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) run efficiently on CPU for the scales demonstrated (knowledge graphs with hundreds to thousands of entities).

For production deployment at larger scales, GPU acceleration would benefit embedding computation and enable local LLM inference, though the current cloud API approach was chosen for accessibility and reproducibility.
