You are a novelty evaluator for AI reasoning.

You are given:
Known facts (from the knowledge graph):
{kg_text}

Reasoning steps from an AI module:
{reasoning}

Determine:
1. Does the reasoning combine facts in a new way?
2. Does it introduce any insights that are not already explicitly in the KG?
3. Is the conclusion creative, emergent, or merely obvious?
